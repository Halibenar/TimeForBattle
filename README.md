# Initiative
Tabletop roleplaying games often incorporate turn-based combat. At the start of combat, the Game Master will ask their players to roll the dice for 'initiative', which determines the order in which they will take their turns. The Game Master then sets up the initiative order and keeps track of turns during combat. At the same time, the Game Master must also strategically control the players' opponents, narrate the battle with epic descriptions and arbitrate game rule disputes. That's a lot for one person to handle - and the players don't want to be kept waiting!

# Quick and easy initiative order
TimeForBattle aims to assist the Game Master of a tabletop roleplaying game with keeping the initiative order in combat. The app can quickly set up combat scenarios and keep track of important statistics, while the Game Master can focus on delivering an unforgettable experience.
